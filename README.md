# Textplay BBEdit Package

## About

This package is designed to make writing in [Textplay][tp] (a varient of [Fountain][fn]) easier.

It includes:

* *Clippings* you might find useful when writing a screenplay
* A *Language Module* that provides basic parsing for Fountain elements, and some document navigation via BBEditâ€™s function menu.
* A *Preview Filter* and *Preview Template* - these allow you to preview Fountain documents using Textplay.
* and some handy *Applescripts* and *Text Filters*.

## Installation

1. I strongly recommend you install [Textplay][tp] first.
2. Download or Clone this repository into your `Application Support/BBEdit/Packages/` directory.
3. Restart BBEdit.
